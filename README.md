# microcom

microcom - A minimalistic terminal program

ctrl-T  it's captured by the window manager and it's not posible to open menu at gnome or mate window managers.
ctrl-\ has been repaced with ctrl-T because using microcom under gtk terminal it's drop the combination key ctrl+\ and others, so menu was never opened.
I also provided a MICROCOM_MENU_KEY envinroment value in order to set your favorite key to open the menu, so you can run as it :

``` 
MICROCOM_MENU_KEY='L' microcom -p /dev/<device_name>
```

```
SYNOPSIS
       microcom [-d] [-f] [-p devfile|-t host:port] [-s speed]

       microcom -h
